ðŸš€ Immediate Next Steps (What We Should Tackle First)
I recommend we start with Phase 1 since it builds directly on your existing foundation. Would you like to begin with:
API Key Management & Validation - Set up secure, production-ready OpenAI API integration
Enhanced Error Handling - Make the system robust against API failures
File Validation - Add proper audio file validation and size limits
